## Deploying openstack on a single node using microstack
- MicroStack is an Ubuntu solution for the installation of OpenStack on a single machine.
- MicroStack was designed for small-scale cloud environments, edge deployments, testing, and development.
- Cloud computing systems like OpenStack, can be complex due to their need to manage many interconnected resources and require certain technical skills to deploy in production.
-  Microstack can be a good stepping stone and starting point. MicroStack is opinionated and not as configurable to help reduce some of the complexity.
